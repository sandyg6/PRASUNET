# Cats vs. Dogs Image Classification Using Support Vector Machine üò∫üê∂

## Project Description

This project aims to build a machine learning model that classifies images of cats and dogs using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled cat and dog images, and it is capable of accurately distinguishing between the two classes. The project includes a Jupyter Notebook for data processing and model training, and a Streamlit application for image classification.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Load and preprocess the image dataset.
- **Model Training**: Train an SVM model on the preprocessed data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- **Interactive Streamlit Interface**: Deploy the model in a Streamlit web application for real-time image classification.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language for data processing and machine learning.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Streamlit**: To create an interactive web application for real-time image classification.
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis
  - `numpy` for numerical computations
  - `scikit-learn` for implementing the SVM algorithm
  - `opencv` for image processing
  - `joblib` for model serialization and deserialization
  - `Streamlit` for building the interactive web application


## How to Run the Project

 **Clone the Repository**:
 
   ```bash
   https://github.com/sandyg6/PRASUNET.git
   ```

 **Run the Streamlit App**:
 
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```


## Results

The SVM model successfully classifies images of cats and dogs with high accuracy. The model's performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix and classification report. The Streamlit application provides an interactive interface for real-time image classification.
