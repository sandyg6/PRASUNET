# Food Image Recognition and Calorie Estimation üßáü•™üçï

## Project Overview

The Food Image Recognition and Calorie Estimation project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content. This project assists users in tracking their dietary intake and making informed food choices. The project involves data collection, preprocessing, model training, and a user-friendly interface for real-time food recognition and calorie estimation using Streamlit.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Compilation and preprocessing of a diverse dataset of food images.
- **Model Training**: Training a machine learning model to recognize food items and estimate their calorie content.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
- **Real-Time Recognition**: Implementing a real-time food recognition and calorie estimation interface using Streamlit.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language for data processing and machine learning.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the machine learning model.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing.
- **Streamlit**: For creating a user-friendly web application interface.
- **Libraries**:
  - `numpy` for numerical computations
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning tasks
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
  - `PIL` for image handling


## How to Run the Project

 **Clone the Repository**:
 
   ```bash
   https://github.com/sandyg6/PRASUNET.git
   ```

 **Run the Streamlit App**:
 
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```


## Results

The food recognition and calorie estimation model achieves high accuracy in recognizing various food items and estimating their calorie content. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. The Streamlit application provides a real-time interface for users to upload food images and receive calorie estimates.
