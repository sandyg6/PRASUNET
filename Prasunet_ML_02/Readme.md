# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering Algorithm üë©‚Äçü¶±üßë‚Äçü¶±

## Project Overview

This project aims to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior using the K-Means clustering algorithm. By identifying these customer segments, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies, improve customer service, and enhance overall customer satisfaction.

## Features

- **Data Collection and Preparation**: Import and preprocess customer data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, normalize numerical features, and encode categorical variables.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Apply the K-Means algorithm to cluster customers and determine the optimal number of clusters.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the clusters using scatter plots.
- **Interactive Streamlit Interface**: Explore the clustering results and visualize the data interactively.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language for data processing and machine learning.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For data exploration, preprocessing, clustering, and visualization.
- **Streamlit**: To create an interactive web application for exploring clustering results.
- **Libraries**: 
  - `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis
  - `numpy` for numerical computations
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
  - `scikit-learn` for implementing the K-Means clustering algorithm
  - `Streamlit` for building the interactive web application


## How to Run the Project

 **Clone the Repository**:
 
   ```bash
   https://github.com/sandyg6/PRASUNET.git
   ```

 **Run the Streamlit App**:
 
   ```bash
   streamlit run house_price_prediction_app.py
   ```

## Results

The project successfully segments customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior. The results are visualized and can be explored interactively through the Streamlit interface.
