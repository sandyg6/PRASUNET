# Hand Gesture Recognition Model üëå‚úåÔ∏èü§ö

## Project Overview

The Hand Gesture Recognition Model project aims to develop a deep learning model capable of recognizing various hand gestures in real-time. This project leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to process and classify hand gesture images. The trained model can be used for applications such as sign language recognition, gesture-based control systems, and enhanced human-computer interaction. The project involves data collection, model training and evaluation, and a real-time recognition interface using a webcam.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Capturing and preprocessing hand gesture images.
- **Model Training**: Training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the collected data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- **Real-Time Recognition**: Implementing a real-time gesture recognition interface using a webcam and Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI).

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language for data processing and machine learning.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the CNN model.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and handling webcam input.
- **Tkinter**: For creating a simple GUI to display the webcam feed and recognition results.
- **Libraries**:
